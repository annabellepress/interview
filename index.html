		<div class="intro-container">
			<div class="intro1">Despite the disadvantages that has come with the pandemic; different time zones, not being able to work alongside classmates and having countless creative blocks, Serena Zhang chooses to utilize the resources she does have at hand, and find new inspirations from everyday life. </div>
			<div class="intro2">Intrigued by the math and science programs in high school, Serena only viewed art as a separate interest, and not something that she considered pursuing as a career. However, she could never ignore the "intrinsic happiness" that drawing and painting brought her. Soon after visitng New York City's various museums and galleries, she knew she wanted to apply to art schools for college.</div>
			<div class="body1">Aside from studying Communication Design, Serena also finds joy in painting, cooking and musicals. The process of oil painting specifically, and watching each layer dry and build on top of another  in order to “produce the nuance of color and light” is very meditative.</div>
			<div class="body2">Braised pork is a Chinese dish that Serena not only enjoys to cook, but finds fascinating in the multiple ways that it can be prepared. She explains that “even the ingredients are the same, different orders and timings of adding these ingredients will cause different flavors.” </div>

			<div class="question"><span class="name"><b>A: </b></span>Have you had any previous experience in communication design?<br> If you did, what did you do and if you didn’t, how did you come</br> to the conclusion that this is what you wanted to study?</div>
			<div class="answer"><span class="name2"><b>S: </b></span>I do not have much professional communication design experience, but I did design some posters and typography previously. I am sure I would like to study communication design just after applying for art schools. To me, communication design is the right combination of rational and creative thinking. In my understanding, designers need to conduct thorough research and then produce both functional and aesthetically pleasing designs.. </div>

	<div class="question2-container">
		<div class="question2"><span class="name"><b>A: </b></span>Do you believe that this balance is limited to communication<br>design practice, or can it extend further?</br></div>
		<div class="answer2"><span class="name2"><b>S: </b></span>The balance might not be limited to communication design. Still, I think the scale will tilt towards rationality for more practical design practices, such as interior and product design, and will tilt towards creativity for illustration and fine arts.</div>

		<div class="creativity-container">
			<div class="creativeQ"><span class="name"><b>A: </b></span>When you are working on a project, do you ever find instances where finding that balance between creativity and rationality becomes difficult?</div>
			<div class="response"><span class="name2"><b>S: </b></span>Sometimes, finding the absolute balance between creativity and rationality can be very difficult. I remembered I was doing a project on the body positively last semester. I wanted to keep a rational mind because it is a severe issue. However, I found my creativity was restricted. Therefore, I think this balance is not a scientific question that has the correct answer. We can let creativity dominate the working process for a while and let rationality take over later.</div>

	<div class="question3-container">
		<div class="question3"><span class="name"><b>A: </b></span>What artist has had a lasting impression/ impact on you (good or bad)?<br> An artist that you just particularly admire the aesthetics of?</br></div>
		<div class="answer3"><span class="name2"><b>S: </b></span>The American painter Edward Hopper impressed me a lot. His works enlightened my passions in painting. I love his use of colors and, most importantly, the scenes he depicted--uncanny snapshots of daily life. However, I learned about how Hopper suppressed the career and ambitions of his wife Jo, who was a talented painter that had fame even before Hopper. Although it was common among artist couples back in the 20th century, I can only admire his paintings' aesthetics after that as his wife modeled most of the female figures in his works.</div>

		<div class="question4-container">
			<div class="question4"><span class="name"><b>A: </b></span>If and when you have artistic blocks, where can you always count to turn to for inspiration? </div>
			<div class="answer4"><span class="name2"><b>S: </b></span>Life and nature. It is beneficial to take a walk and look at people on the street, trees in the park, and the sky's color. Everything in life can be an inspiration. Reading is another source of inspiration. Reading poems and proses can open my imagination. </div>

	<div class="question5-container">
		<div class="question5"><span class="name"><b>A: </b></span>Have you found that these hobbies (even if they are another form of art) influence your current art practice and its creative thought process? Vise versa? In what ways?</div>
		<div class="answer5"><span class="name2"><b>S: </b></span>I think every aspect of life can influence my art practices because I like to gain inspiration from daily life. For example, last year, I did a project of sculpting the lunch boxes of the three generations in my family. I believe that my love for cooking helped me develop the idea and sculpt each piece of food.</div>

		<div class="steamed-container">
			<div class="body3">During the summer months, when being in quarantine was becoming more and more neverending, Serena, nevertheless, found inspiration from her feelings of homesickness. While being stuck in NYC, she designed a character, Mr. Steamed Bun. </div>
			<div class="quote">“I missed the steamed buns from my hometown. It is a character I drew for fun. Because my friends liked it and I started to create a series of images for it. I plan even to make gifs and draw some storyboards for this character in the future.”</div>
